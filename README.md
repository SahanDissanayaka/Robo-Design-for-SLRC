# Robot Design for SLRC

## About SLRC
The Sri Lankan Robotics Challenge (SLRC) is a competition organized by the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa. It has two categories: the School Category and the University Category.

## The Team
We are a team of five undergraduates from the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, known collectively as "We are Groot." Our team members are:

1. Sahan Dissanayaka
2. Senum Dodangoda
3. Sandaru Liyanaarachchi
4. Pasindu Kulasingham
5. Dilshan Nuwantha

We proudly achieved a top 15 position in the university category and emerged as finalists in the competition.

## Our Task
Our project tasks are inspired by the concept of infinity stones in the Avengers Movie. For detailed information, please refer to the attached PDF document.

## Project Tasks
Consists of three planets
1. Planet A - Mountains in Vormir
2. Planet B - Ruins in Sakaar
3. Planet C - Thanosâ€™s Home


- Line Following: Utilized an IR array and PID controller for precise navigation.
- Wall Color Detection: Employed a ToF sensor and rear-mounted color sensor for wall identification.
- Color Junction Detection: Utilized two under-mounted color sensors for identifying color junctions.
- 3D Object Detection: Employed a ToF sensor for detecting object shapes.
- Metal Box Detection and Grabbing: Determined box conductivity for metal detection and utilized a robotic arm for manipulation.
- Wall Following: Implemented front and side-mounted ultrasonic sensors for navigating through the junkyard.
- Obstacle Height Detection: Utilized two ToF sensors and one ultrasonic sensor to measure object heights.

## Methodology

Each task was executed using advanced sensors and control algorithms:

### Line Following
Utilized an IR array in conjunction with a PID controller for accurate line tracking.

### Wall Color Detection
Employed a ToF sensor for wall detection and a rear-mounted color sensor for precise color identification.

### Color Junction Detection
Utilized strategically placed under-mounted color sensors to detect color junctions effectively.

### 3D Object Detection
Utilized advanced ToF sensor technology to accurately detect the shapes of objects.

### Metal Box Detection and Grabbing
Implemented conductivity testing to identify metal boxes and utilized a robotic arm for efficient grabbing.

### Wall Following
Employed a combination of front and side-mounted ultrasonic sensors for effective wall following.

### Height Detection
Utilized a combination of ToF and ultrasonic sensors to accurately measure object heights.
